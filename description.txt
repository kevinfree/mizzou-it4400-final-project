This Application generates random mazes.
It was developed by Kevin Free for IT 4400 at the University of Missouri.
The algorithm employed is a modified depth first search algorithm, using a list of all cells and a stack to create the maze.
For more information, view the source code.

To generate a maze, type a value fornumber of rows between 3 and 100 and a value for speed % between 1 and 100.
Speed % affects how quickly the maze generates.
Select a passage bias* from the drop down box. 
Then hit Go! 
If you abort a maze generation, you can hit Go! again to start a new one, but you cannot resume the maze it was making.
The entrance is at the top left and exit at the bottom right of the maze.
Enjoy!

*Passage bias affects the algorithm's choices by making the biased direction more likely to be chosen for the next cell.
Optional input for the bias magnitude field must be an integer from 1 to 10.
This will increase the likelihood of that path being chosen when the algorithm makes decisions from 75% to 95% likelihood.
